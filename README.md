# Ubuntu Butterfly ðŸ¦‹ image builder ðŸ“€

This project is a work-in-progress ðŸš§ and far from complete, it builds OS images for Ubuntu Butterfly developers to tinker with. Approach with caution ðŸ›‘ **Certainly Ubuntu Butterfly is not a usable OS and the images available here are not representative of what Ubuntu Butterfly will become.** ðŸ”®

## Usage

```bash
sudo ./image-build.sh
```

The `image-buiild.sh` script will install the required software on the host and then start and automated build. After a few minutes you should have a `ubuntu-butterfly.iso` ready for use which [`quickemu`](https://github.com/quickemu-project/quickemu) can run for you ðŸ˜‰

## BEWARE! ðŸ’¥

 - A copy of [`machinespawn`](https://github.com/wimpysworld/machinespawn) will be dropped in `/usr/local/bin` if a copy is not found in your `$PATH`.
   - `machinespawn` is also alpha software.
 - No hashes are generated, yet.

## Reference

This build script is inspired by the fantastic work of [Marcos Vallim](https://github.com/mvallim) and [Ken Gilmer](https://github.com/kgilmer) on [live-custom-ubuntu-from-scratch](https://github.com/mvallim/live-custom-ubuntu-from-scratch).
